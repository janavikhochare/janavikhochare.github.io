<span style="font-weight:500; font-size: 25px" > Hello there!</span>

I hold a Master's degree in Electrical and Computer Engineering from Georgia Tech, specializing in Machine Learning. My academic excellence is matched by a passion for innovative projects. Currently, I am focused on developing advanced quantization techniques for continual learning in Large Language Models on edge devices. <br>

During my internship at Norfolk Southern in the summer of 2023, I tackled real-world challenges by developing a peak signal detection algorithm for railroad hot boxes with 98% accuracy and creating a statistical framework for short-term bearing temperature forecasting. <br>

Previously, as a Data Scientist at Purplle.com in Mumbai, I enhanced user experiences through personalized recommendations using collaborative filtering and reinforcement learning. I led initiatives to solve cold start and product discovery issues, deploying real-time recommendation systems that significantly increased user engagement and sales. My solutions resulted in a 3% uplift in CTR and CTB, along with a 2.5% increase in orders. <br>

As an undergraduate researcher at Veermata Jijabai Technological Institute, I contributed to projects involving audio and video deepfake detection, anomaly detection, and wind speed forecasting, leading to publications in prestigious conferences and journals. <br>

My technical skills include Python, C++, SQL, R, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Keras, Spark, Docker, and cloud infrastructures like GCP and AWS.<br>

I intend to use this website to give the world a peek into my mind and share updates about my work.<br>

<h4>Research Interests</h4>
My primary area of research centers around the confluence of various domains, including Machine Learning, Deep Learning, Multi-modal Data, Recommendation systems, Natural Language Processing, and Large Language Modeling. Additionally, I have recently been deeply involved in projects related to Delta compression for continuous updates of large language models on edge devices.
