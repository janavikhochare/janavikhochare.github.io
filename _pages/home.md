<span style="font-weight:500; font-size: 25px" > Hello there!</span>

I am a graduate student at [Georgia Institute of Technology (Georgia Tech)](https://www.gatech.edu/) where I am pursuing a Master's in Electrical and Computer Engineering, specializing in Machine Learning and AI. I am currently involved in research at the [Pathology Dynamics Lab](https://sites.gatech.edu/cassie-mitchell-lab/) at Georgia Tech, where I work on biomedical information extraction using natural language processing (NLP) techniques under the guidance of [Prof. Cassie Mitchell](https://sites.gatech.edu/cassie-mitchell-lab/people/pi-profile/). I am working on developing a new approach for [Entity Linking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Entity_linking) using [hierarchical contrastive learning](https://arxiv.org/abs/2204.13207) based on [Large Language Models (LLMs)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model).<br>

In Fall 2023, I interned as an Applied Scientist at [Amazon](https://www.amazon.science/). I worked on efficiently tailoring Large Language Models (LLMs) for text generation. <br>

Prior to joining Georgia Tech, I worked with [Infosys Limited](https://www.infosys.com/) as a Software Engineer in Retail Consumer Logistics division, where I am responsible for automating the complete work flow of generating CRUD reports for migration of an application from Mainframe systems to SAP. I was also involved in Interface Enhancement team. I completed my undergraduate studies with Silver Medal at [Amrita Vishwa Vidyapeetham](https://www.amrita.edu/). <br>

I intend to use this website to give the world a peek into my mind and to share updates about my work.

<h4>Updates</h4>

<br>

<h4>Research Interests</h4>
 I am broadly interested in the intersection of Multimodal and multi-task learning, contrastive learning and self-supervised learning. More specifically, my research interests include [Natural Language Processing](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural_language_processing), [Natural Language Understanding](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Natural-language_understanding), [Large Language Models](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Large_language_model), [Vision Language Models](https://huggingface.co/blog/vision_language_pretraining), and [Reinforcement Learning](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reinforcement_learning).
