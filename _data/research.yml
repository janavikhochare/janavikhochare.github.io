  description: Large Language Models (LLMs) excel in language tasks with examples, but their control through prompts has inherent limitations. <br> In this work, we introduce <b>Controlled Text Generation at Inference Time (COGIT)</b>, which combines a large base Language Modelâ€™s output distribution with that of a smaller-sized model (an adapter policy).
